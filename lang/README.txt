Salaren Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged Salaren language files,
for making the Salaren interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for Salaren is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to Salaren, you can either:

 1) use the Salaren languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually
